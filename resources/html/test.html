        <p>Background: Working in a small company with highly skilled colleagues - I feel competent in programming
            stuff, but I lack many skills such as debugging network issues, git beyond "clone, add ., commit, push.",
            debugging issues related to programming environment (i.e. some library is missing). Time is quite precious
            for us, and any work I can do is worth quite a lot. (There is so much too learn and I am grateful for that
            opportunity!) So anyways...</p>
        <p>Yesterday I finally had a breakthrough that demystified much of git to me! These kinds of revelation-moment
            are usually the product of much time spend on learning something, but I still wanted to share the process of
            what I have done.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>What did I do?</strong> </p>
        <p>I wanted to learn what a <code>rebase</code> does.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new folder and create a new git repo.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create two files with some text in them: <code>main.code</code> and <code>lib.code</code> + commit
                    them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create two branches: "potionbrewing" and "rocketflying", in each do some modifications and commits.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>View the result with the tool "tig".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rebase one branch onto the other (with a tab open that tells me how to do it)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>That was is basically! I played around a bit more, with more branches, but that was mainly it. Not much, but
            it felt sooo good to finally understand what it going on.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>What was helpfull about this process?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Focus on git: I reduced the "coding" to a minimum. With each commit, I added/changed 1-2 lines. That
                    way, I spent most of my time on learning git.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Get visual feedback with tig (gitk is another good alternative): Felt pretty satisfying and made sure
                    that I did the right things.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Focus on one new thing at the time: In this case, on <code>rebase</code>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <p>That&#39;s it, I hope I could inspire at least someone to also just get their hands dirty instead of reading
            tutorial #32 ;) Next up for me: Fast-forward, getting competent in merging scenarios (Also important: "how
            to provoke conflicts?" by merging, by checkouts, by popping stash, ...)</p>
        <p>Happy hacking!</p>
